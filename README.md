  ## What is this project?

Portable hardware devices for hacking have become popular with Flipper Zero being the main one and also the most sought after. Given the difficulty of obtaining the famous gadget, this repository aims to document and, where possible, implement more accessible options for carrying out the same attacks on cheaper and easier-to-obtain controllers such as those in the M5Stack family.

## Why this name?

Orcas are the largest species in the dolphin family (Delphinidae). Like dolphins, they are intelligent, social mammals with a complex communication system. Orcas are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. The name Orca One was chosen as a reference to the name of the coveted device named after the famous dolphin.
